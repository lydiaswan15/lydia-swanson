            <h3>HELLO MY NAME IS</h3>
            <h1>LYDIA SWANSON</h1>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m a senior at BYU-Idaho studying software engineering with an emphasis in web development. 
                I am passionate about creating full-stack applications that are both beautiful and functional. 
                In my spare time I enjoy camping, blasting classical music, and eating an unhealthy amount of cold cereal.
